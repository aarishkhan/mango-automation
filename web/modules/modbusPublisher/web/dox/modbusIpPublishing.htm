<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    The MODBUS publisher allows publishing of Mango data point to a Slave Modbus device that is accessible on the localhost 
    at the given port.  Each publisher only allows 1 slave but it is possible to create multiple publishers with unique Slave ids.
    All publishers that have the same port number will be Slaves within the same Slave Set (Modbus Server).  It also possible to 
    create multiple Slave Sets as long as they are on different ports.
    
      <b>Caution on selecting a port, since port 502 is below 1024 it is a secure port and on linux is only openable if Mango is run 
    with proper privileges.</b>
</p>


<h1>Publisher Configuration</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Port</b> is the port number that is opened to accept incomming connections.
 </p>
<p>
  The <b>Slave id</b> is the Slave Id for this group of data points.  Since multiple slaves can be created on one Mango
  instance it is important to organize the points with the correct slave id.  The generally accepted maximum slave id is 247.
 </p>
<p>
  When the messages are <b>Encapsulated</b> the modbus message contains a length within the message and doesn't require the Master or Slave to read the TCP/IP Header.
 </p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>
 Ensure you have the proper privileges to open port 502.

<h1>Published Point Configuration</h1>

<p>When adding a point to be published the following information is available.</p>

<p>The <b>Name</b> is the data point name.</p>

<p>The <b>Status</b> shows whether the point is enabled or disabled</p>

<p>The <b>Type</b> show the data type for the point.  This is important as it restricts the Modbus settings for the point.</p>

<p>The <b>Register range</b> can be 1 of 4 types, Coil, Input, Holding Register or Input Register.  Coils and Inputs can only contain Binary data while the registers can contain any data type.</p>

<p>The <b>Offset</b> is the 0 based location where the data will start.  It is important to understand how large your data is so that you can space out the data and not have data overlap. 
For example, each offset location represents 2 bytes of data so if you are publishing a Numeric piece of data you must space your next point at least 4 offsets away.
</p>

<p>The <b>Modbus data type</b> is not selectable.  This is chosen by Mango depending on the data type of the point you are publishing. 
<ul>
    <li>Numeric point types are published as 8 byte floats</li>
    <li>Multistate point types are published as 8 byte signed integers</li>
    <li>Binary point types are published as binary data (the lowest bit of the first byte in a register)</li>
    <li>Alphanumerica point types are published as Variable length strings.  The string size is always even as to fill out the full register.  An odd length string is 0-padded at the end</li>
</ul>
