  Use the "purge report instances" settings to set the maximum age of a report instance before it is purged from the 
  database. Purging permanently deletes the report instance. It is best to set this value as low as possible since 
  reports can potentially consume a great deal of available storage space. Purging can be prevented by setting the 
  "prevent purge" attribute on the report instance.
