<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Data file data points can serve two functions. The first is to represent the imported data for the rest of the functions provided 
by Mango, as with a typical data point. The second maps a particular column header string to the XID of another data point, so as to 
import the history as the target's.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>

<ul><li><b>Mapping Point</b> determines if this point will attempt to attach its values to the toXid point</li>
<li><b>toXid</b> is the XID of the point you want this history imported into.</li>
<li><b>fromIdentifier</b> is the identifier in the file to be imported that matches this point.</li></ul>
